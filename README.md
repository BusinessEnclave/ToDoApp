## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1:** "What are your reactions to the Android app development platform so far? Compare and contrast Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces in past platforms you've used."

**Answer:** I am a Micorsoft .net developer and everyday live on Visual Studio. I found Android Studio very much user freindly and was able to relate to Visual Studio. I was able to do this task without much hastle.

**Question 2:** "Take a moment to reflect on the `ArrayAdapter` used in your pre-work. How would you describe an adapter in this context and what is its function in Android? Why do you think the adapter is important? Explain the purpose of the `convertView` in the `getView` method of the `ArrayAdapter`."

**Answer:** ArrayAdapter here act as the bridge between the List View and the Adapter View, it generates the view and supply it to the List View.

## Notes

Very first time i am working with JAVA, found challenging the edit funtionality with "Start Activity" , I did dleclare the position golbally and passed that to main view .
